**Desk Buddy** is a playful experiment by Nele and Amanda. 

A webcam tracks how much we slouch over our laptops and sends this data to an AI. The AI responds with supportive, annoying, or just curious reactions — from comments to sounds or images. It’s less about serious research and more about exploring how AI might notice and react to our bodies beyond language.
